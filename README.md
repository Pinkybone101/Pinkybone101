Hey! The name's Zen, pleased to meet you, stranger.
The focus of my life is Arknights, Touhou, DnD and hating myself!
I'm currently learning the entirety of Project Odin, but my current focus is Ren'py and visual novels.
I'm not really looking to collaborate.
Don't reach out to me. But if you want to, my reddit is u/vhrossi1.
